### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** This app will be useful for people short on time who want a convenient way to expand their vocabulary on the go, for example on the bus, standing in line, or while waiting for your coffee to brew. The app will use the Oxford Dictionary API, Back4App to store profile information, push notifications for daily reminders, and audio voice recognition for searching words. 
- **Story:** Learn new words with Lexicool! An app to help you expand your vocab. This app is suited to anyone with the motivation and will to learn new things, with the aim of the app to make the learning experience as smooth as possible.
- **Market:** The size of the market avaibale is everyone who speaks english, so quite large. Addiotionally, the future possibility of expanding the list of languages offered will only open up the market size furhter. The app is available for anyone who wants to learn, but would require heavy marketing to become popular and really lift off. 
- **Habit:** A streak system will be put in place to motivate the user to log on every day and learn atleast one new word. Push notifications will be sent to remind the user on a daily basis. A reward system could be implemented to give further motivation to form the habit.
- **Scope:** Although the scope is quite wide and there are many features that we hope to add, we believe that it is quite doable within the time given by the course. A stripped down version would still be interesting, however, it would take away from the habit forming ideology of the app.
